/*
1. Constructor and Initial State
Test that the contract is initialized with the correct game settings.
Test that initial fuel and fanning are zero.
Test that initial flame history and account statuses are set correctly.
2. Pausing and Unpausing
Test that only the owner can pause and unpause the contract.
Test that appropriate functions are restricted when the contract is paused.
3. Lighting the Flame
Test that the flame can be lit when the size is zero.
Test that the flame cannot be lit when it's already lit.
Test the correct increment in fuel and fanning after lighting the flame.
4. Tending to the Flame
Test different actions (FAN, FUEL) and their effects on the state.
Test the restrictions on when an address can tend to the flame.
Test the effects on an address's total stats and blame after tending.
5. Governing the Flame
Test different actions (ACCUSE, DEFEND) and their effects on the blame level of an address.
Test the restrictions on when an address can govern.
Test the effects on an address's total govern stats after governing.
6. Flame Size Calculation
Test the flame size calculation with different flame activities and settings.
Test the decay of the flame size over time.
7. Edge Cases and Security Considerations
Test with maximum and minimum possible values for different parameters.
Test for potential re-entrancy or other common vulnerabilities.
